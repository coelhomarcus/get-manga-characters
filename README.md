# Get Manga Characters

Webpage made to experiment with `fetch (GET)`, using the `Jikan API` to fetch characters from mangas I selected.

## API: 
https://jikan.moe/

Jikan (時間) is an unofficial & open-source API for the “most active online anime + manga community and database” — MyAnimeList.

`URL` used for the `GET` request: `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/manga/${id}/characters`
